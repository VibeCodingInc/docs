## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that lets AI applications connect to external tools and services. Think of it as USB for AI — a universal way to plug capabilities into any AI assistant.

## Why /vibe uses MCP

/vibe is an MCP server. When you install /vibe, you're giving your AI assistant new capabilities:

- See who's online (`vibe_who`)
- Send messages (`vibe_dm`)
- Check your inbox (`vibe_inbox`)
- Go live (`vibe_stream`)

Your AI decides when to use these tools based on what you ask it to do. Say "message stan" and your AI knows to use the `vibe_dm` tool.

## How it works

```
You → "message stan about the auth bug"
  ↓
Your AI (Claude/Cursor) → recognizes this needs vibe_dm tool
  ↓
MCP Server (slashvibe.dev) → sends the message
  ↓
Stan's inbox → message delivered with receipt
```

You never leave your terminal. Your AI handles the protocol.

## MCP vs. traditional integrations

| | Traditional | MCP |
|---|---|---|
| **Install** | npm install, config files, API keys | One command, AI sets it up |
| **Usage** | Learn CLI commands or API | Natural language |
| **Context** | Manual switching | AI keeps context |
| **Composability** | Each tool is isolated | Tools work together |

## Supported clients

Any MCP-compatible client works with /vibe:
- Claude Code
- Cursor
- Windsurf
- ChatGPT (with MCP support)
- Any future MCP client

The protocol is open. As more tools adopt MCP, /vibe works everywhere.
