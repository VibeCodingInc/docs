## Every party starts small

The first people in the room set the tone for everyone after.

We launched with 100 genesis spots. Not because we think we're exclusive — because we want to get the culture right before we scale.

## Hosts, not bouncers

Our founding members aren't gatekeepers. They're **hosts**. When you get an invite, someone is introducing you to a room they care about.

Think of /vibe as a party, not a club. Everyone's invited — you just need someone already there to bring you in.

## The invite system

Every member gets 3 invite codes. That's it. Same for everyone — no tiers, no VIP treatment.

Why invites? Because every new person changes the mix. We've seen what happens when platforms optimize for growth over culture. We're choosing the other path.

## What we believe

**Jazz session, not competition.** Builders riffing off each other, not competing for likes.

**Terminal party, not velvet rope.** The door is open. We just want you to meet the people already inside.

**Early internet, not late capitalism.** Human-scale computing for the age of AI.

## The promises

- We will never sell your data
- We will never add ads
- We will never optimize for "engagement"
- We will open up — just not yet

## Historical lineage

This isn't a new idea. It's a pattern:

| Year | Community | Lesson |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1985 | The WELL | Culture is the moat |
| 1995 | AOL | Hosts, not bouncers |
| 2004 | Gmail | Authentic scarcity |
| 2004 | Facebook | Cohort expansion |
| 2026 | /vibe | Intentional growth |

Every great online community started small and grew with intention. We're doing the same thing.
