## The problem

You're deep in a coding session. Claude is helping you debug an auth flow. You're in the zone.

Then you need to ask a teammate something. So you open Slack. Context switch. Scroll through channels. Find the person. Type your message. Wait. Go back to terminal. Try to remember where you were.

Twenty minutes of mental state — gone.

## It gets worse with AI

AI-assisted coding is the loneliest form of programming. You're in a terminal, talking to an AI, with no connection to the thousands of other people doing the same thing right now.

The tools are getting smarter. The experience is getting more isolated.

Every other computing platform shift created a new social layer:
- PCs gave us forums and BBS
- The web gave us social networks
- Mobile gave us messaging apps
- AI-native coding gave us... nothing

Until now.

## The solution

/vibe is the social layer for your coding environment. It adds two things:

**Presence**: See who's building right now. Not a follower count — a live room of people actively working.

**Messaging**: DM anyone without leaving your terminal. Get delivery receipts. Know they saw it. Know they're building.

No channels. No threads. No notification hell. Just: who's online, and direct messages between people who ship.

## Why it matters

Context switching kills flow. Every time you leave terminal, open a browser, check Slack, come back — you lose deep focus.

/vibe keeps you in the zone. Your social layer lives where your work lives.

```
"hey claude, message @stan about this auth bug"
```

Claude sends it. You stay in terminal. Stan replies. You keep shipping.

## The feeling

Remember the early internet? Before the feeds, the algorithms, the engagement metrics? When going online felt like walking into a room full of interesting people who were excited to meet you?

That's the vibe.
