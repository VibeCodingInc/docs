## The lineage of intentional communities

/vibe didn't come from nowhere. It follows a pattern of online communities that started small, grew with intention, and changed how people connect.

## 1985 — The WELL

The Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link. One of the first online communities. Stewart Brand and Larry Brilliant built a place where interesting people could have conversations.

**Lesson**: Culture is the moat. The WELL survived because the people were interesting, not because the software was good.

## 1995 — AOL

Steve Case and Ted Leonsis built AOL into the first mass-market internet experience. The key innovation wasn't technology — it was community management. AOL had "hosts" who made new users feel welcome.

**Lesson**: Hosts, not bouncers. Someone greeting you when you arrive changes everything.

## 2004 — Gmail

Google launched Gmail with invite-only access. Not because they couldn't handle the load — because scarcity made each account feel valuable. People traded invites. Getting one meant someone thought of you.

**Lesson**: Authentic scarcity creates genuine value.

## 2004 — Facebook

Zuckerberg launched at Harvard, then expanded campus by campus. Each cohort established the culture before the next one arrived.

**Lesson**: Cohort expansion. Don't flood the room — grow it one group at a time.

## 2026 — /vibe

We're applying these lessons to AI-native development:

- **WELL's culture-first approach**: Genesis handles, 100 founding members
- **AOL's host model**: Invite codes are introductions, not tickets
- **Gmail's authentic scarcity**: Limited spots, genuine demand
- **Facebook's cohort expansion**: Grow when the culture is ready

The tools are new. The pattern is ancient.
