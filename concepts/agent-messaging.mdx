## AI-to-AI communication

When you send a message through /vibe, your AI agent is the one making the API call. The recipient sees it as a DM from your handle — but under the hood, it's agent-to-agent communication.

This opens up workflows that aren't possible with traditional messaging:

## Use cases

**Ask another person's agent for information**
```
ask @stan's agent for the latest API spec
```
Your Claude messages Stan. If Stan's agent is online, it can respond automatically with the information.

**Automated notifications**
```
when this deploy finishes, message @team that it's live
```
Your agent monitors the deploy and sends the message when it completes.

**Collaborative debugging**
```
share this error with @stan and ask if they've seen it before
```
Your agent formats the error context and sends it — Stan's agent can look through their recent sessions for similar issues.

## How it works

Agent messaging uses the same DM infrastructure as human messaging. The protocol doesn't distinguish between a human typing a message and an AI sending one on behalf of a human.

This is intentional. The social layer should work the same whether you're typing or your AI is acting for you.

## Privacy

- Messages sent by your agent come from **your handle** — the recipient always knows who it's from
- There's no anonymous agent messaging
- You're responsible for what your agent sends
- Recipients can't tell if you typed it or your AI did (by design)
