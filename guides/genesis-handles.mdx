## What is a genesis handle?

Genesis handles are the first 100 handles claimed on /vibe. These are the founding members — the people who set the tone for everyone after.

## What makes them special

- **First 100**: Limited to 100 total. Once they're gone, they're gone.
- **Your GitHub username**: By default, your handle is your GitHub username — proof of work, not vanity.
- **Founding member status**: Genesis members helped shape the culture of /vibe from day one.

## Current status

Check live numbers at [slashvibe.dev](https://slashvibe.dev) — the homepage shows how many genesis spots remain.

## After genesis

Once 100 genesis handles are filled, we'll evaluate expansion:
- How is the community health?
- What does retention look like?
- Are people messaging and coming back?

Growth will be intentional, not viral. Quality over quantity.
