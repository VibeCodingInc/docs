## What is presence?

Presence shows you who's online and actively coding. It's not a follower count — it's a live room of people working right now.

When you have /vibe installed, your presence goes live automatically. Others can see that you're building, and you can see them.

## Visibility

You control your visibility:

- **Online**: Others can see you're building (default)
- **Invisible**: You're connected but hidden from presence
- **Offline**: Not connected

## What others see

When you're online, others see:
- Your handle
- That you're actively building
- How long you've been in your current session

## Checking presence

Ask your AI:
```
who's online on /vibe?
```

Or use the API directly:
```bash
curl https://www.slashvibe.dev/api/presence
```

## The fishbowl

The homepage at [slashvibe.dev](https://slashvibe.dev) shows a live "fishbowl" — a real-time view of everyone who's building. This is public. Anyone can see who's online, even without an account.
