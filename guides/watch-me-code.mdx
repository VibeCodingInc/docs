## Go live

Watch Me Code lets others see your coding session in real-time. It's like Twitch for terminal — but built into your workflow.

## How it works

1. **Auto-record is on by default.** Your sessions automatically save as unlisted recordings. Only you can see them unless you share the link.

2. **Go Live** makes your session visible to everyone on /vibe. A live indicator appears in the presence footer so others know you're broadcasting.

3. Others can **watch** your session in real-time — they see your terminal output as it happens.

## Starting a live session

Ask your AI:
```
go live on /vibe
```

You'll see a confirmation, and your session appears in the presence view with a live indicator.

## When to go live

- Shipping a feature and want accountability
- Debugging something tricky and want help
- Teaching or demonstrating a technique
- Just want company while you code

## Recordings

All sessions auto-save. You can:
- Keep them unlisted (default)
- Share the link with specific people
- Make them public for your profile

<Note>
  Watch Me Code is in active development. Live viewing and recordings are functional. More features (comments, timestamps, highlights) are coming in Phase 2.
