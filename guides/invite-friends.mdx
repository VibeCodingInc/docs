## How invites work

Every /vibe member gets **3 invite codes**. Same for everyone — no tiers, no VIP treatment.

When someone redeems your invite, they're joining a room you care about. You're not a bouncer — you're a host.

## Generating invite codes

Ask your AI:
```
generate a /vibe invite code
```

Share the code or link with someone you want to bring in.

## Why invites?

Every new person changes the mix. We've seen what happens when platforms optimize for growth over culture.

Our invite system communicates:
- "We want to get this right" (care for quality)
- "Every new person changes the mix" (care for culture)
- "Your invite is an introduction, not a ticket" (care for relationships)

## Genesis phase

We launched with 100 genesis spots. These are the founding members of /vibe. Once genesis spots are filled, we'll evaluate the next expansion cohort.
