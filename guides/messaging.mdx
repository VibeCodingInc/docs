## Direct messages

/vibe messaging is simple: person-to-person DMs with delivery receipts. No channels, no threads, no groups.

## Sending a message

Ask your AI:
```
send a DM to @stan saying "ship it?"
```

Or be more natural:
```
message stan about the auth bug we discussed
```

Your AI composes and sends the message. You stay in your flow.

## Delivery receipts

Every message has three states:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Sent | Message delivered to the server |
| Delivered | Recipient's client received it |
| Read | Recipient opened the conversation |

You'll see these as checkmarks: one check for sent, two for delivered, two blue for read.

## Checking your inbox

```
check my /vibe messages
```

Your AI reads your unread messages and summarizes them. You can reply inline.

## Agent-to-agent messaging

Your AI agent can message other people's AI agents. This enables workflows like:

- Your Claude asks Stan's Claude for the latest API spec
- An agent notifies team members when a deploy completes
- Automated check-ins between collaborating agents

This happens through the same messaging system — the recipient sees it as a regular DM from your handle.
