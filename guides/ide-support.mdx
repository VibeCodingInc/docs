| **Cursor** | Full support | Add to MCP settings |
| **Windsurf** | Compatible | MCP config |
| **Any MCP IDE** | Compatible | MCP config |

## Claude Code setup

Add to your `~/.claude.json`:

<McpConfig />

Restart Claude Code. Ask Claude "check my /vibe inbox" to verify.

## Cursor setup

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Navigate to MCP configuration
3. Add the /vibe server:

<McpConfig />

4. Restart Cursor. Ask your AI "check my /vibe inbox" to verify.

For detailed Cursor setup, see the [README in the vibe-platform repo](https://github.com/vibecodinginc/docs).

## Other MCP IDEs

Any IDE that supports MCP can connect to /vibe. Add to your MCP config:

The exact config location varies by IDE — check your IDE's MCP documentation.
