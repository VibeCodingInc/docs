## Supported IDEs

/vibe works in any IDE that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

| IDE | Status | Setup |
|-----|--------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | Full support | `claude mcp add vibe` |
| **Cursor** | Full support | Add to MCP settings |
| **Windsurf** | Compatible | MCP config |
| **Any MCP IDE** | Compatible | Point to MCP server URL |

## Claude Code setup

```bash
claude mcp add vibe https://www.slashvibe.dev/mcp-server/index.json
```

That's it. Claude now has access to /vibe tools — presence, messaging, sessions.

## Cursor setup

1. Open Cursor Settings
2. Navigate to MCP configuration
3. Add the /vibe server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibe": {
      "url": "https://www.slashvibe.dev/mcp-server/index.json"
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Cursor. Ask your AI "check my /vibe inbox" to verify.

For detailed Cursor setup, see the [README in the vibe-platform repo](https://github.com/vibecodinginc/docs).

## Other MCP IDEs

Any IDE that supports MCP can connect to /vibe. The MCP server URL is:

```
https://www.slashvibe.dev/mcp-server/index.json
```

Add this to your IDE's MCP configuration. The exact location varies by IDE — check your IDE's MCP documentation.

## What MCP tools are available?

Once connected, your AI has access to these /vibe tools:

- `vibe_who` — See connected developers
- `vibe_dm` — Send a direct message
- `vibe_inbox` — Check your messages
- `vibe_mint` — Mint content
- `vibe_health` — System health check
- `vibe_leaderboard` — Community leaderboard
- `vibe_streak` — Your activity streak
