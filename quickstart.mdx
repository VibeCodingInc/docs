## The fast way

Tell Claude (or any MCP-compatible AI):

```
go to slashvibe.dev and install /vibe
```

Claude reads the install page, downloads the MCP server config, and sets it up. You're done.

## Manual install

If you prefer to set it up yourself:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in with GitHub">
    Go to [slashvibe.dev](https://slashvibe.dev) and sign in with GitHub. Your handle defaults to your GitHub username.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install the MCP server">
    Add the /vibe MCP server to your IDE config:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Claude Code">
        ```bash
        claude mcp add vibe https://www.slashvibe.dev/mcp-server/index.json
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Cursor">
        Add to your Cursor MCP settings (see [Cursor setup guide](/guides/ide-support)):
        ```json
        {
          "mcpServers": {
            "vibe": {
              "url": "https://www.slashvibe.dev/mcp-server/index.json"
            }
          }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Other MCP IDEs">
        Any IDE that supports MCP can connect to /vibe. Point your MCP config to:
        ```
        https://www.slashvibe.dev/mcp-server/index.json
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send your first message">
    Ask Claude:
    ```
    who's online on /vibe?
    ```
    Then message someone:
    ```
    send a DM to @seth saying hello
    ```
    You'll see delivery receipts: sent, delivered, read.
  </Step>
</Steps>
