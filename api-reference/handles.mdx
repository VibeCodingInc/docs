## Check availability

```bash
GET /api/handles/check?handle=yourname
```

### Response

```json
{
  "available": true,
  "handle": "yourname"
}
```

## Claim a handle

Handles are claimed during the GitHub OAuth flow. By default, your GitHub username becomes your handle.

## Reserve a handle

```bash
POST /api/handles/reserve
Authorization: Bearer TOKEN

{
  "handle": "friendname"
}
```

Reserved handles are held for 30 days. Use this to save a handle for someone you're inviting.
