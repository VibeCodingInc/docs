## Base URL

```
https://www.slashvibe.dev/api
```

All endpoints are served over HTTPS.

## Authentication

Most read endpoints are public. Write endpoints require a session token obtained through GitHub OAuth.

```bash
# Public (no auth needed)
curl https://www.slashvibe.dev/api/presence

# Authenticated
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://www.slashvibe.dev/api/messages
```

See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for the full OAuth flow.

## Core endpoints

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Presence](/api-reference/presence) | Who's online, heartbeats, visibility |
| [Messages](/api-reference/messages) | Send DMs, read inbox, delivery receipts |
| [Handles](/api-reference/handles) | Claim, check availability, reserve |
| [Sessions](/api-reference/sessions) | Watch Me Code, recordings, go live |
| [Invites](/api-reference/invites) | Generate and redeem invite codes |

## Rate limits

- Public endpoints: 60 requests/minute
- Authenticated endpoints: 120 requests/minute
- Presence heartbeats: 1 per 5 seconds

## MCP tools

If you're using /vibe through an MCP client (Claude Code, Cursor), you don't need to call the API directly. The MCP server wraps these endpoints into tools your AI can use.

See [MCP Tools Reference](/building/mcp-tools) for the tool interface.
