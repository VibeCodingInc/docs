## Get online users

```bash
GET /api/presence
```

Returns a list of currently online users with their status.

### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "online": [
    {
      "handle": "seth",
      "status": "building",
      "since": "2026-01-28T10:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "count": 14
}
```

## Send heartbeat

```bash
POST /api/presence
Authorization: Bearer TOKEN

{
  "handle": "yourhandle",
  "status": "building",
  "task": "debugging auth flow"
}
```

Heartbeats keep your presence alive. Send one every 30 seconds. If no heartbeat is received for 2 minutes, you go offline.

## Set visibility

```bash
POST /api/presence/visibility
Authorization: Bearer TOKEN

{
  "handle": "yourhandle",
  "visible": false
}
```

Set `visible: false` to go invisible. You're still connected but hidden from the presence list.
