## Overview

/vibe uses GitHub OAuth for authentication. This aligns with our developer-first identity — your GitHub profile is your proof of work.

## OAuth flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initiate auth">
    Redirect the user to:
    ```
    GET https://www.slashvibe.dev/api/auth/github
    ```
    Optional query params: `handle`, `redirect_uri`, `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`
  </Step>
  <Step title="GitHub authorization">
    User authorizes the /vibe OAuth app on GitHub. Scopes requested: `read:user`, `user:email`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Callback">
    GitHub redirects to the callback URL with an authorization code. The server exchanges this for an access token and creates a session.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Session token">
    The callback returns a session token. Use this for authenticated API calls:
    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer SESSION_TOKEN" \
      https://www.slashvibe.dev/api/messages
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Handle assignment

- If no handle is specified, your GitHub username becomes your /vibe handle
- Handles are lowercase, alphanumeric, and unique
- Genesis handles (first 100) are permanent

## Token lifetime

Session tokens expire after 30 days of inactivity. Active sessions are refreshed automatically.
