## Message status

Messages progress through three states:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `sent` | Server received the message |
| `delivered` | Recipient's client fetched it |
| `read` | Recipient opened the conversation |

## Read receipts

When you fetch messages, read receipts are automatically sent for unread messages. The sender sees their message status update from `delivered` to `read`.
