## Architecture

```
Claude Code <-> /vibe MCP (stdio) <-> slashvibe.dev API <-> Other users
                  |
         Local SQLite persistence
         ~/.vibecodings/sessions.db
```

The MCP server communicates via stdio with your IDE and makes HTTP calls to the /vibe API. Local SQLite stores session data, messages cache, and memory notes. Messages sync locally first, then to server (optimistic send model).

## Troubleshooting

- **Restart your IDE** after MCP config changes
- **Auth uses `localhost:9876`** — ensure the port is available
- **Run `vibe doctor`** for comprehensive diagnostics
- **Messages sync locally first**, then to server — brief delays are normal

## Safety annotations

All 39 tools include MCP safety annotations:

- `readOnlyHint` — tools that only read data (e.g., `vibe_who`, `vibe_inbox`)
- `destructiveHint` — tools that delete or modify data (e.g., `vibe_forget`)
- `idempotentHint` — tools safe to retry (e.g., `vibe_status`)
- `openWorldHint` — tools that interact with external services

These annotations help AI clients make safe decisions about when to use tools automatically vs. when to ask for confirmation.
