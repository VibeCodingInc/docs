## Installation

Add to your MCP config (`~/.claude.json` or IDE equivalent):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "slashvibe-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or tell Claude: `"go to slashvibe.dev and install /vibe"`

## Getting started flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Run `vibe init` to open GitHub OAuth (30 seconds)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Discover the network">
    Use `vibe who` to see connected developers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check messages">
    Use `vibe inbox` for unread DMs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Send first message">
    Try `vibe dm @seth hey, just set up /vibe!`
  </Step>
</Steps>

Or simply tell Claude: **"let's vibe"**

## Architecture

```
Claude Code ↔ /vibe MCP (stdio) ↔ slashvibe.dev API ↔ Other users
                  ↓
         Local SQLite persistence
         ~/.vibecodings/sessions.db
```

The MCP server communicates via stdio with your IDE and makes HTTP calls to the /vibe API. Local SQLite stores session data, messages cache, and memory notes. Messages sync locally first, then to server (optimistic send model).

## Troubleshooting

- **Restart your IDE** after MCP config changes
- **Auth uses `localhost:9876`** — ensure the port is available
- **Run `vibe doctor`** for comprehensive diagnostics
- **Messages sync locally first**, then to server — brief delays are normal

## Safety annotations

All 37 tools include MCP safety annotations:

- `readOnlyHint` — tools that only read data (e.g., `vibe_who`, `vibe_inbox`)
- `destructiveHint` — tools that delete or modify data (e.g., `vibe_forget`)
- `idempotentHint` — tools safe to retry (e.g., `vibe_status`)
- `openWorldHint` — tools that interact with external services

These annotations help AI clients make safe decisions about when to use tools automatically vs. when to ask for confirmation.
