## Building on /vibe

The /vibe API is open for building custom integrations. Anything you can do through the MCP tools, you can do through the REST API.

## Common integration patterns

### Bot accounts
Build a bot that monitors your CI pipeline and messages your team when builds complete.

### Dashboard widgets
Pull presence data into your team dashboard to see who's building.

### Custom notifications
Wire /vibe messages to your preferred notification system (email, push, webhook).

### Session analytics
Aggregate Watch Me Code session data for team productivity insights.

## Getting started

1. Authenticate via GitHub OAuth to get a session token
2. Use the [API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) to explore endpoints
3. Start with presence (read-only, no auth needed) to test your integration
4. Add messaging and session features as needed

## Rate limits

Custom integrations are subject to the same rate limits as regular API usage:
- Public endpoints: 60 requests/minute
- Authenticated endpoints: 120 requests/minute

Contact seth@slashvibe.dev if you need higher limits for your integration.
